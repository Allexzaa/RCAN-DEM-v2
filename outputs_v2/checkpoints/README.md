# Checkpoints

Place **best_model.pth** here for inference and evaluation.

**Note:** `best_model.pth` is ~181 MB and exceeds GitHub's 100 MB file limit, so it is not stored in this repo. To share it via GitHub, use [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (`git lfs track "*.pth"` then add and push), or upload it as a [Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github) asset.
